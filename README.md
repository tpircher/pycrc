Copyright of the generated source code
--------------------------------------

The MIT licence allows commercial use of the source and the output of the
program. But since I got asked on occasion whether the generated code is
encumbered by the copyright of the author, I give my view on this:

The code generated by pycrc is not considered a substantial portion of the
software, therefore the licence does not cover the generated code; the
author of pycrc will not claim any copyright on the generated code.
