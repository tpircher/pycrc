=====

[pycrc](https://pycrc.org) is a free, easy to use Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
calculator and C source code generator.


System Requirements
-------------------

Python 3.7 or newer is required to run pycrc.
The last version compatible with Python 2 is v0.9.x.

Running pycrc
-------------

This program doesn't need to be installed to be run. The script can be
executed from the source directory.
Simply call the python interpreter with the script as parameter:

    python3 src/pycrc.py [options]

Installation
------------

Install pycrc (if required) using pip:

    python3 -m pip install pycrc

or apt (on Debian 13 and later, Ubuntu 23.10 and later, and
derivatives):

    sudo apt install pycrc

Either of these will install a `pycrc` binary in the path.

Copyright of the generated source code
--------------------------------------

The MIT licence allows commercial use of the source and the output of the
program. But since I got asked on occasion whether the generated code is
encumbered by the copyright of the author, I give my view on this:

The code generated by pycrc is not considered a substantial portion of the
software, therefore the licence does not cover the generated code; the
author of pycrc will not claim any copyright on the generated code.
